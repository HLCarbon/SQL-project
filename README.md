# SQL project
 This is my first SQL project

### Welcome to my SQL project

In this project I look at the data from Covid deaths from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths. 

#### How this is organized:
I used Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to analyse the data. The file [SQLQuery1.sql](https://github.com/HLCarbon/SQL-project/blob/main/SQLQuery1.sql) contains multiple different queries used to analyse and clean data.

### Hope you enjoy!
